# GEMINI.md — Gemini CLI / Google AI Studio

Read **AGENTS.md** for full project context, critical rules, module maps, and roadmap priorities. That file is the single source of truth for all AI coding agents on this project.

## Gemini-Specific

- **Always check TODO.md** at the start of substantive work. If you spot gaps, missing items, or things the owner might have missed, add them to the appropriate phase in TODO.md. Don't wait to be asked. TODO.md is gitignored and local-only.
- **OPSEC is non-negotiable.** Read the "OPSEC — Anonymity & Remote-First" section in AGENTS.md. Never output real names, personal emails, or location details. This applies to every commit, file, and generated content.
- **Two-brand architecture:** "Provara" is the public brand. "Hunt Information Systems" is the private legal entity. All public-facing content uses "Provara" only. See AGENTS.md for details.
