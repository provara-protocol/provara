## 2. About Section

I build memory infrastructure.

Not chatbot memory. Not RAG pipelines. The layer underneath — tamper-evident, cryptographically signed event logs that give AI agents verifiable cognitive continuity and give families an inheritable digital legacy that doesn't depend on any company surviving.

I designed and built the Provara Protocol: an open source, offline-first memory system using Ed25519 signatures, SHA-256 hash chains, Merkle trees, and deterministic event sourcing. Every observation is signed, every event is causally chained, and the current state is always recomputed from evidence — never merged. The reference implementation is seven Python modules, 110 passing tests (93 unit + 17 compliance), one external dependency, and a compliance suite any reimplementation can validate against.

The problem I'm solving is straightforward. Every AI agent memory system on the market today — Mem0, Zep, LangChain memory — is cloud-dependent, vendor-locked, and offers zero cryptographic proof that your agent's memory hasn't been modified. When that provider pivots or shuts down, your agent's cognitive continuity disappears with it. For families, the same structural failure exists: your digital life is scattered across services that owe you nothing beyond their current terms of service, and none of it is verifiable or inheritable in any meaningful technical sense.

Provara solves both with the same architecture. No blockchain. No consensus mechanism. No vendor lock-in. No network dependency. The data format is JSON, SHA-256, and Ed25519 — industry standards that will be readable in 50 years with nothing but a text editor and a crypto library. The protocol is frozen at v1.0 and licensed Apache 2.0.

Right now I'm consulting on AI memory architecture for teams building autonomous agents and robotic systems, and building the Family Vault — a desktop application that makes sovereign, tamper-proof digital legacy accessible to non-technical users.

If you're building autonomous agents and need verifiable cognitive continuity, let's talk.

## 3. Experience Entry

**Title:** Founder & Principal Engineer
**Company:** Hunt Information Systems
**Duration:** Feb 2026 – Present

Designed, built, and open-sourced the Provara Protocol — a sovereign, tamper-evident memory system for AI agents and humans. Provara uses Ed25519 digital signatures, SHA-256 hash chains, Merkle tree integrity sealing, and deterministic event sourcing to create verifiable, offline-first cognitive continuity infrastructure. The reference implementation is seven Python modules with 110 passing tests (93 unit + 17 compliance), a single external dependency, and a cross-language compliance suite. Licensed Apache 2.0.

The protocol serves two distinct audiences with identical architecture. For AI and robotics teams, Provara provides a portable, vendor-independent memory layer where an agent's observations, beliefs, and policy constraints live in a cryptographically verifiable chain of evidence that migrates across embodiments. For families, it provides a digital vault — tamper-proof records stored in human-readable formats designed to be inheritable for generations without cloud accounts, proprietary exports, or subscription dependencies.

Currently shipping consulting engagements for AI memory architecture design — including tamper-evident audit trail implementation, custom event reducers, key management strategy, and Provara integration into existing agent frameworks — while building the Family Vault desktop application to bring sovereign digital legacy to non-technical users.

## 4. Featured Section Suggestions

1. **GitHub Repository — Provara Protocol**
   https://github.com/huntinformationsystems/provara
   Pin this first. The repo is the credibility anchor: working code, 110 tests, Apache 2.0 license, full README. Anyone can clone it, run the compliance suite, and read the event log in a text editor.

2. **Launch Article — "I Built a Cryptographic Memory Vault — Here's the Protocol"**
   Publish to LinkedIn as a native article or link from your blog. This is the technical deep dive that explains the architecture, the cryptographic primitives, the dual-audience insight, and the design constraints. Best single piece for establishing technical authority.

3. **Provara Protocol Site — provara.dev**
   https://provara.dev
   The protocol's home page. Clean, authoritative, links to the spec and the repo. Positions Provara as infrastructure, not a product pitch.

4. **Hunt Information Systems — Company Site**
   https://huntinformationsystems.com
   Link to the consulting services page. This is where inbound leads from LinkedIn should land when they want to hire you for AI memory architecture work.
