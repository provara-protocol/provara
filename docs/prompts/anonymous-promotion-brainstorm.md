## The Prompt

```
You are a strategic advisor for an anonymous open-source founder. Here is the situation:

CONTEXT:
- I run a one-person LLC (registered, legal, tax-compliant) that publishes open-source developer infrastructure software.
- The product is a cryptographic protocol for tamper-evident AI memory — think "git for AI agent state, with Ed25519 signatures." It's shipped as a Python package on PyPI and as an MCP server for AI coding tools.
- The LLC is the public identity. I am pseudonymous — my legal name is NOT associated with the project publicly. I want to keep it that way.
- I work fully remote and location-independent. No office, no physical presence, no geography tied to the brand.
- The project is Apache 2.0 licensed, free and open-source. Revenue will come from hosted services, enterprise features, and support contracts — not from selling the code itself.
- The codebase, documentation, package metadata, LICENSE, and all public artifacts already use only the company name and brand email. Git history has some legacy personal commits (known tradeoff, accepted).
- I have secured or am securing: domains, PyPI, npm, Docker Hub, GitHub org, and social handles — all under the brand.

CONSTRAINTS:
- I will NOT use my real name, personal email, personal social media, or physical location in any public-facing material.
- I will NOT fabricate a fake team or pretend to be larger than I am. Honesty about scale is non-negotiable.
- I will NOT do anything legally questionable. The LLC is real, taxes are filed, contracts are signed properly.
- I CAN use "we" and "the team" as brand voice without implying headcount.
- I CAN eventually hire a public-facing DevRel person or community manager to be "the face."
- I CAN speak at virtual conferences, write blog posts, and engage on social media — all under the brand.

MY TARGETS:
- Primary audience: AI developers, agent framework builders, security-conscious engineers
- Secondary: enterprise compliance teams, open-source enthusiasts
- Tertiary (future): families who want verifiable digital legacy vaults

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:
1. Give me a comprehensive, actionable promotion strategy that maximizes brand visibility while maintaining founder anonymity.
2. Rank every channel and tactic by: (a) effectiveness for my audience, (b) anonymity safety, (c) effort required.
3. Identify the top 5 highest-leverage moves I can make in the next 30 days with zero budget.
4. Identify the top 5 moves that require budget but have outsized ROI.
5. Flag any promotion tactics that commonly leak founder identity (even accidentally) and explain how to avoid each one.
6. Give me a 90-day phased rollout plan with specific milestones.
7. Address the "trust gap" — how do anonymous/pseudonymous projects build credibility when there's no human face attached? Give me concrete examples of projects that did this successfully.
8. Suggest a brand voice and messaging framework that works for a faceless technical brand. Give me 5 example tweets, 3 blog post titles, and 1 HN launch post draft.
9. Tell me what NOT to do — the common mistakes anonymous founders make that either expose them or kill their traction.
10. Be brutally honest about the tradeoffs. Where will anonymity cost me growth? Where is it actually an advantage?

FORMAT: Use headers, bullet points, and prioritization tiers (P0/P1/P2). Be specific and tactical, not generic. I don't need theory — I need a playbook I can execute this month.

## Usage Notes

- Works with any major AI model (GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, Mistral, etc.)
- Paste the full prompt as-is — it's self-contained
- For deeper dives on specific sections, follow up with: "Expand on section [N] with specific examples and step-by-step instructions"
- To adapt for a different product vertical, change the CONTEXT section only — the rest is universal
- Re-run quarterly as the business evolves — anonymity needs change with scale
