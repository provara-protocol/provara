# Protocol Spec

The normative specification is frozen in `PROTOCOL_PROFILE.txt`.

- Local source of truth: `PROTOCOL_PROFILE.txt`
- Published spec mirror: [docs/spec/v1.0/provara-v1.0-spec.txt](spec/v1.0/provara-v1.0-spec.txt)

Implementation code, tests, and tooling must conform to the spec. The spec is never edited to match implementation behavior.
